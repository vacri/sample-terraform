AWS Account Settings
====================

This module is for all the small once-off things that we'll have in each AWS account. Things that are basically something you toggle on once for the entire account and then forget about.

Larger 'common' items (eg: our standard VPCs) are more complex and deserve their own stacks, even if we don't tend to reconfigure them often. In their own stacks it will be easier to analyse as everything will be semantically related.
