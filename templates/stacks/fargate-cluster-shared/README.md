Requires an ACM certificate to be manually made before running for the first time, and the ARN needs to be put into terraform.tfvars

ACM certs can't be easily autogenerated for any of our domains because DNS is not controlled by AWS for them.

TODO: this can be achieved in Terraform, but I have other things on my plate first
1. request an ACM cert for a domain name in our control
2. get the CNAME entries for the pending cert
3. apply those entries to cloudflare DNS
    * have a mechanism that doesn't cause issues if the entry already exists but isn't under control of this stack
        * this happens if someone has already made an ACM cert for a given domain on the AWS account
4. wait for the ACM cert to 'issue'
5. continue on with the rest of the stack
